    A wedged NVIDIA driver parks its callers in uninterruptible sleep, so a

    back. The poll loop therefore cannot report its own hang: it is stuck
    before the point where it would publish anything, and the liveness probe
    only sees a frozen loop and restarts the container, which discards the
    evidence and hangs again.

    This watchdog closes that gap by treating "the probe did not return" as a
    positive finding. It runs on its own thread so the driver cannot block it.
    Delivery is retried until ``on_hang`` succeeds: a hung poll loop has no
    "next cycle" to fall back on, so a single failed publish would otherwise
    lose the event for the life of the process.

    ``on_hang`` must complete within a bounded time. ``poll_once`` holds the
    watchdog lock across the callback so a concurrent probe return cannot emit
    recovery before the unhealthy event is committed. The platform connector
    bounds critical delivery with ``CRITICAL_EVENT_DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``.
