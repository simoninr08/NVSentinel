// Package auth binds an incoming health event to the identity of its publisher.
//
// platform-connector listens on a host-mounted Unix socket that is shared by
// two classes of publisher:
//
//   - Node-local publishers (syslog, nic, gpu, preflight checks, custom
//     monitors) only ever report the node they run on. They present a
//     projected ServiceAccount token whose node claim attests where they run;
//     tokenless callers are also still accepted, pinned to this node.
//   - Cluster-scoped publishers (csp-health-monitor, kubernetes-object-monitor,
//     nvcre-certification-monitor, slurm-drain-monitor, health-events-analyzer)
//     run centrally and must be
//     able to name any node in the cluster. They present a projected
//     ServiceAccount token minted for a dedicated audience, and their
//     ServiceAccounts are explicitly allowlisted.
//
// The node name arrives as a plain field on the event and is not re-derived
// anywhere downstream: fault-quarantine cordons it verbatim and
// fault-remediation stamps it onto the RebootNode CR. A publisher that names
// the wrong node therefore has its mistake carried all the way through to a
// cordon, drain or reboot of that node. This interceptor is the one place the
// claim can be checked against who is making it.
//
// A caller presenting a token is asked two independent questions.
//
// First, is the token being presented where it was issued? The API server
// writes the bound pod's node into the token at issuance, so a claim that names
// a different node means the token has been carried off its node and replayed,
// and the request is rejected. This applies to every token-presenting caller,
// allowlisted or not: it is about the credential's provenance, not about what
// its holder is entitled to say. Tokens from clusters that do not embed node
// info carry no claim and skip this question.
//
// Second, may this identity name nodes other than this one? Only the
// explicitly allowlisted ServiceAccounts may. Everyone else — tokenless
// callers, and authenticated callers that are not on the list — is scoped to
// this connector's own node, where a blank node name is filled in and a
// different one is rejected.
//
// Rejection, rather than silently rewriting a foreign node name to the local
// one, is deliberate: a rewrite would turn a misdirected event about node B
// into a real event against node A, and would hide the misconfiguration that
// produced it.
//
// The whole batch is validated before any of it is mutated or forwarded, so a
// batch is either accepted in full or rejected in full.
//
// The deployment platform connector serves the whole fleet over the network
// and uses the same interceptor with no local node (Config.NodeName empty).
// Everything above holds, with the node the caller's token claims in place of
// the connector's own: there is no socket to vouch for where a caller runs,
// so every caller must present a token bound to a scheduled pod, its events
// are pinned to that pod's node, and, since anything on the network can reach
// the listener, only the allowlisted publishers may call at all.

// Cross-node reach lets one caller have any node in the cluster cordoned,
// drained and rebooted, so it is granted only against a token the API server
// tied to a specific running pod on a specific node:
//
//   - No pod binding. `kubectl create token <sa>` without --bound-object-ref
//     authenticates as the ServiceAccount with the right audience but is tied
//     to nothing, so it is replayable from anywhere for its whole lifetime.
//   - Pod binding but no node claim. A token bound to a pod that has not been
//     scheduled carries a pod UID and no node, so verifyNodeClaim has nothing
//     to compare and skips. Anyone able to create a pod that never schedules —
//     an unsatisfiable nodeSelector is enough — could otherwise mint a
//     credential with cluster-wide authority and no node binding at all.
//
// An absent node claim is refused here rather than read as "this must be an old
// cluster": NVSentinel requires Kubernetes 1.34+ (see README), and pod-node
// info has been GA since 1.32, so every scheduled pod's token carries a node.
// Node-local callers of the node-local connector keep the permissive
// treatment, because their scope is the connector's own node — exactly what
// reaching the socket already grants — so a claimless token gains them
// nothing. Without a local node there is no such fallback: the claim is the
// only thing that says which node the caller may report on.
