## Platform Connectors

### Health Event Authentication Metrics

These track the node-binding interceptor that stops a caller on one node from
submitting health events naming another node. See
[Health Event Authentication](platform-connectors.md#health-event-node-binding).

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `platform_connector_auth_decisions_total` | Counter | `decision` | Health event batches by the node scope granted to the caller. Values: `node_local`, `cross_node` |
| `platform_connector_auth_node_claim_total` | Counter | `result` | Whether an authenticated caller's token carried a node claim. `verified`: it carried one and it named this node (on the deployment platform connector, which has no node of its own, the claim is taken as the caller's node). `absent`: it carried none, so the caller was pinned to this node, the same scope a tokenless caller gets; on the deployment platform connector such a caller is rejected instead (`node_claim_absent`). |
| `platform_connector_auth_violations_total` | Counter | `reason` | Health event batches that violated the node-binding rule. Under `global.platformConnectorAuth.mode: enforce` (default) these are rejected; under `mode: audit` they are recorded here but let through. Reasons: `node_mismatch` (a node-local caller named a different node), `node_claim_mismatch` (the token was issued on another node; applies to every caller, allowlisted or not), `unbound_cross_node_token` (an allowlisted caller presented a token bound to no pod, e.g. from `kubectl create token`), `cross_node_claim_absent` (pod-bound, but the pod was never scheduled), `missing_node_name` (no node name on the event and none could be stamped), `token_invalid` (TokenReview rejected the token), `malformed_credentials` (the authorization header was duplicated or did not use the Bearer scheme). Four reasons occur only on the deployment platform connector, which has no local node to fall back to: `token_missing` (no token at all), `unbound_token` (a token bound to no pod), `node_claim_absent` (a token bound to a pod that never scheduled, so no node to pin its events to) and `identity_not_allowed` (an authenticated identity not listed in `ALLOWED_PUBLISHERS`). Three further reasons mean **no verdict could be reached**, not that the caller was rejected: `validator_unavailable` (the API server was unreachable), `validator_timeout` (the caller gave up or its deadline passed) and `validator_error` (an unexpected failure, typically this component's own RBAC to create TokenReviews). With `failOpenOnUnavailable: true`, `validator_unavailable` and `validator_timeout` still increment this counter but fall back to a degraded node-local scope instead of rejecting the request, in `mode: enforce` too, because an outage says nothing about the caller's credential. That scope is a guess, not a verified identity: an event with a blank or matching node name is accepted and stamped as usual in either mode, but one naming a different node depends on `mode`: under `enforce` it is refused as retryable `Unavailable` rather than counted as `node_mismatch`, since the caller might really be an allowlisted cross-node publisher the outage prevented from being verified; under `audit` that same `Unavailable` is recorded and then let through like any other audited violation, so the event is forwarded with whatever node name it carried. `missing_node_name` is the one violation `mode: audit` does not let through: a blank node name from a caller resolved to **verified** cross-node scope is always rejected, in both modes, because nothing downstream can handle it. This does not cover a caller that fell back to a degraded node-local scope under `failOpenOnUnavailable`: its identity was never verified as cross-node, so a blank name from it is stamped like any other node-local caller's. Exclude those three when alerting on suspected credential abuse, because a control-plane outage increments them for every in-flight request and would otherwise look identical to an attack: `sum(rate(platform_connector_auth_violations_total{reason=~"node_mismatch\|token_invalid\|node_claim_mismatch\|unbound_cross_node_token\|malformed_credentials\|cross_node_claim_absent\|missing_node_name"}[5m]))` |

### Kubernetes Connector Metrics

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `k8s_platform_connector_node_condition_update_total` | Counter | `status` | Total number of node condition updates by status. Status values: `success`, `failed`, `skipped` (an update that would leave the node's conditions as they are, such as a monitor's repeat of a fault the node already shows, is skipped) |
| `k8s_platform_connector_node_event_operations_total` | Counter | `operation`, `status` | Total number of node event operations by type and status. Operation values: `create`, `update`. Status values: `success`, `failed`, `skipped` (a repeat of a fault whose Event was written less than 10 minutes ago is skipped; later repeats refresh the Event) |
| `k8s_platform_connector_node_condition_update_duration_milliseconds` | Histogram | - | Duration of node condition updates in milliseconds. Uses linear buckets (0, 10, 500) |
| `k8s_platform_connector_node_event_update_create_duration_milliseconds` | Histogram | - | Duration of node event updates/creations in milliseconds. Uses linear buckets (0, 10, 500) |

### Prometheus Connector Metrics

Every health monitor publishes through the platform connector, so this one metric covers
`gpu-health-monitor`, `syslog-health-monitor`, `nic-health-monitor`, `csp-health-monitor`,
`kubernetes-object-monitor` and `health-events-analyzer` without per-monitor instrumentation.
Enabled with `platformConnector.promConnector.enabled` (default `false`, like the other optional connectors).

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `health_events_total` | Counter | `node`, `agent`, `check_name`, `recommended_action`, `is_fatal`, `is_healthy` | Health events received by the platform connector. `recommended_action` is the enum name (`NONE`, `CONTACT_SUPPORT`, `RESTART_VM`, …); a `CUSTOM` action reports as `CUSTOM` rather than expanding `customRecommendedAction`, which is operator-defined and unbounded |

`node` carries the **event's own** `nodeName`, not the node of the connector pod that
received it. That distinction matters: the DaemonSet monitors publish over the node-local
socket so the two coincide, but `health-events-analyzer` is a Deployment whose derived
events describe other nodes, and an allowlisted cross-node publisher can name any node. An
explicit label makes every agent correct without a `kube_pod_info` join.

`errorCode` is excluded because it is unbounded: suffixed XIDs such as
`145.RLW_SRC_TRACK` would grow the series set without limit. `node` is bounded by the fleet.

`is_fatal` is kept even though producers derive it as `recommendedAction != NONE`. The
redundancy is the point: a producer that disagrees with that derivation becomes visible
rather than silent.

Useful queries:

```promql
# Actionable event rate by action, fleet-wide
sum by (recommended_action) (rate(health_events_total{recommended_action!="NONE"}[5m]))

# Which agent and check is producing the actionable events
sum by (agent, check_name) (rate(health_events_total{recommended_action!="NONE",is_healthy="false"}[1h]))

# Per node, correct for every agent including health-events-analyzer
sum by (node) (rate(health_events_total{recommended_action!="NONE"}[1h]))
```

### Platform Connector Request Metrics

Both roles of the platform connector, the node-local DaemonSet and the deployment platform connector, expose these for the batches that reach the request handler. Alert on `failed` outcomes and on best-effort failures. The deployment platform connector (`PC_MODE=deployment`) also exposes the metrics above for its Kubernetes connector and for the node-binding interceptor (its rejections are counted in `platform_connector_auth_violations_total`, by the reasons listed there), and the refusals below, which it answers before the handler sees the batch.

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `platform_connector_request_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `outcome` | Duration of health event batch requests that reached the handler, by outcome: `ok` (acknowledged), `rejected` (the batch is invalid), `failed` (the connector returned an error while processing the batch; the caller retries). Both roles expose it: on the node-local DaemonSet the connector is the set of ring buffers, which always accept, so a batch is `ok` once queued unless it is invalid; on the deployment platform connector the datastore write decides. |
| `platform_connector_deployment_refusals_total` | Counter | `reason` | Batches refused before the handler saw them: `index_unverified` (this replica has not verified the idempotency index; the caller retries) or `idempotency_key` (the idempotency-key header is missing or malformed) |
| `platform_connector_store_batches_total` | Counter | `outcome` | Batches written to the datastore by either role: `stored`, or `duplicate` (a resend, or a retried batch, whose events already existed; treated like a store) |
| `platform_connector_best_effort_failures_total` | Counter | `connector`, `reason` | Work a best-effort connector (`kubernetes` node conditions and Events, `grpcsink` forwards) did not finish although the batch was acknowledged: `failed` or `timeout`; the node shows the old state until the monitor next reports |

### Workqueue Metrics

These metrics track the internal ring buffer workqueue performance:

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `platform_connector_workqueue_depth_{name}` | Gauge | `workqueue` | Current depth of Platform connector workqueue |
| `platform_connector_workqueue_adds_total_{name}` | Counter | `workqueue` | Total number of adds handled by Platform connector workqueue |
| `platform_connector_workqueue_latency_seconds_{name}` | Histogram | `workqueue` | How long an item stays in Platform connector workqueue before being requested. Uses linear buckets (0, 10, 500) |
| `platform_connector_workqueue_work_duration_seconds_{name}` | Histogram | `workqueue` | How long processing an item from Platform connector workqueue takes. Uses linear buckets (0, 10, 500) |
| `platform_connector_workqueue_retries_total_{name}` | Counter | `workqueue` | Total number of retries handled by Platform connector workqueue |
| `platform_connector_workqueue_longest_running_processor_seconds_{name}` | Gauge | `workqueue` | How many seconds the longest running processor for Platform connector workqueue has been running |
| `platform_connector_workqueue_unfinished_work_seconds_{name}` | Gauge | `workqueue` | The total time in seconds of work in progress in Platform connector workqueue |

**Note:** `{name}` in the metric names is replaced with the actual workqueue name at runtime.

## Change Stream Metrics

Emitted by `store-client`, so they appear on every module that reads the change stream:
`event-exporter`, `fault-quarantine`, `health-events-analyzer`, `node-drainer`, and
`fault-remediation`, on both the MongoDB and PostgreSQL providers. The `client` label is the
consumer's name.

`fault-remediation` serves only controller-runtime's registry, so it passes that registry
explicitly; the others use the default registry.

| Metric Name | Type | Labels | Description |
|------------|------|--------|-------------|
| `change_stream_lag_seconds` | Gauge | `client` | Seconds since this consumer last had evidence it was caught up with its own change stream, from either an empty batch or the server-side timestamp of the last event it read. Absent until one of those has been observed |
| `change_stream_lag_known` | Gauge | `client` | 1 once `change_stream_lag_seconds` can be computed for this consumer, 0 before then |
| `change_stream_resume_token_recoveries_total` | Counter | `client`, `phase` | Times a stale or invalid resume token was deleted, restarting the stream from the current position |

Lag is measured against the consumer's **own filtered stream**, so a module whose pipeline
admits nothing still reports zero lag while it is caught up. See
[ADR-054](designs/054-changestream-lag-metrics.md).

### Suggested alerts

```yaml
# A consumer is behind. Tune the threshold per fleet; no lag_known qualifier is needed,
# because the series is absent rather than zero while lag is unknown.
- alert: ChangeStreamConsumerBehind
  expr: change_stream_lag_seconds > 900
  for: 10m

# A watcher that never started, or is wedged before its first read. The grace period covers
# normal startup, which closes in milliseconds on a live stream.
- alert: ChangeStreamLagUnknown
  expr: change_stream_lag_known == 0
  for: 10m
```

### What zero lag does not tell you

Each of these is a way a consumer can be behind while the gauge reads zero.

1. **Replication lag.** The MongoDB stream is opened `SecondaryPreferred` with no max staleness,
   so an empty batch means "caught up with the secondary I am reading", not with the primary.
2. **Data skipped after a resume-token recovery.** When a stored token is too old for the oplog
   the watcher reopens from now, so lag reads near zero precisely when the most was skipped.
   Read `change_stream_lag_seconds` together with `change_stream_resume_token_recoveries_total`:
   a lag of zero is only reassuring if the recoveries counter has not moved.
3. **Durable position.** This measures the watcher's progress against its own stream, not
   whether its position was persisted. A consumer that reads an event and dies before
   `MarkProcessed` succeeds looks healthy here, because the read did happen.

## Metrics Configuration

### Scraping Metrics

All NVSentinel components expose Prometheus metrics on a metrics endpoint (typically `:2112/metrics`). The metrics can be scraped by Prometheus using standard scrape configurations.

### Helm Chart Configuration

The NVSentinel Helm chart automatically creates a `PodMonitor` resource for Prometheus Operator integration:

```bash
helm install nvsentinel ./distros/kubernetes/nvsentinel \
  --namespace nvsentinel --create-namespace
```

The PodMonitor is configured to scrape all NVSentinel component pods on their metrics endpoints (`/metrics` on port `metrics`).

### Annotation-based Discovery

Components can be configured to include Prometheus scrape annotations:

```yaml
annotations:
  prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
  prometheus.io/port: "2112"
  prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
```

## Metric Types Reference

- **Counter**: A cumulative metric that only increases or resets to zero on restart
- **Gauge**: A metric that can arbitrarily go up and down
- **Histogram**: Samples observations and counts them in configurable buckets
- **Summary**: Similar to histogram but calculates configurable quantiles over a sliding time window
