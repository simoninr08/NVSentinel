platform-connector: who may submit health events, and about which node.

## Health-event publishers (platform-connector)

```yaml
global:
  platformConnectorAuth:
    enabled: true
    mode: enforce
    failOpenOnUnavailable: false
    audience: "platform-connector.nvsentinel.nvidia.com"
    tokenExpirationSeconds: 3600
    tokenMountPath: "/var/run/secrets/nvsentinel/platform-connector"
    crossNodeServiceAccounts: []
```

### `enabled`

Must be a **real YAML boolean** and must be set explicitly — there is no
default. A quoted `"false"` is refused rather than read as `true`, and `null`
or `0` is refused rather than silently disabling enforcement. The connector
also refuses to start if the ConfigMap omits the key, so an old chart driving
new images fails loudly instead of guessing whether authentication is required.

Disabling this lets any caller that can reach the connector's socket submit an
event naming any node. It is not a supported production configuration.

### `mode`

`enforce` (default) rejects a request that violates the node-binding rule.
`audit` validates every request and increments the same
`platform_connector_auth_violations_total` counters by reason, but lets the
request through instead of rejecting it.

Use `audit` to roll node-binding out against real traffic: run it for a
period, confirm the violation counters stay at zero, then switch to `enforce`
with evidence rather than finding out what it breaks in production. `audit`
still requires `enabled: true`, and every request is still validated: a
validator failure (including `validator_unavailable` and
`validator_timeout`) is still recorded, it just no longer rejects the
request. `audit` changes what happens after a violation is detected, not
whether requests are checked.

One rejection is not affected by `mode`: an event with no node name from a
caller resolved to **verified** cross-node scope (`missing_node_name`) is
always rejected, in both `audit` and `enforce`. Nothing downstream can handle
an empty node name, so forwarding that event would not be a useful preview of
what `enforce` would do — it would just be an event `enforce` could never
have produced, sitting in the datastore. This does not cover a caller that
fell back to a **degraded** node-local scope under `failOpenOnUnavailable`:
its identity was never verified as cross-node in the first place, so a blank
name from it is stamped like any other node-local caller's — see
[`failOpenOnUnavailable`](#failopenonunavailable).

### `failOpenOnUnavailable`

Distinguishes a validator that never reached a verdict from one that reached
a verdict and rejected the credential. `validator_unavailable` and
`validator_timeout` (the API server was unreachable, or the call timed out)
say nothing about the caller — they are not evidence of a forged token, only
of the validator's own availability. `token_invalid` (a rejected or malformed
credential) does say something about the caller and is always rejected under
`mode: enforce`, regardless of this setting.

Defaults to `false`: an unreachable validator rejects the request, matching
behaviour before this setting existed. Set `true` to fall back to a
**degraded** node-local scope instead — a guess, not a verified identity —
so that a control-plane blip degrades publishers to their own node rather
than blocking their health events outright:

- An event with a blank or matching node name is accepted and stamped exactly
  as a verified node-local caller's would be, in either `mode`. This is the
  common case the setting exists for: most publishers present a token but
  leave the node name blank for platform-connector to fill in.
- An event naming a *different* node is handled according to `mode`. Under
  `mode: enforce` it is refused as retryable `Unavailable` — the same code
  the validator itself returned — rather than as `node_mismatch` /
  `PermissionDenied`. The caller might really be an allowlisted cross-node
  publisher the outage prevented from being verified, not an actual mismatch,
  so it is not counted as `node_mismatch` (one of the reasons an operator
  would alert on as suspected credential abuse) and not rejected in a way
  publishers treat as non-retryable; it is retried once the validator
  recovers instead of being dropped for good. Under `mode: audit` that same
  `Unavailable` is what gets recorded and then let through by `auditOrReject`
  like any other violation, so the event is forwarded with whatever node name
  it carried.

### `audience`

The single audience every publisher's token is minted for, and that
platform-connector requires TokenReview to echo back in `status.audiences`.
A token issued for a different service is not accepted.

### `tokenExpirationSeconds`

Token lifetime. Kubernetes rejects a projected token lifetime below **600**
seconds or above **2^32**, and rejects fractional values, so the chart enforces
`600 <= x <= 4294967296` and whole numbers at render time rather than letting
the API server reject the pod at creation.

### `tokenMountPath`

Directory each publisher mounts the token at; the file is `<mountPath>/token`.

### `crossNodeServiceAccounts`

**Additional** canonical usernames permitted to report health events about nodes
other than the one they run on. Every entry grants the ability to have any node
in the cluster cordoned, drained and rebooted — add sparingly.

The bundled cluster-scoped monitors — `csp-health-monitor`,
`kubernetes-object-monitor`, `nvcre-certification-monitor`,
`slurm-drain-monitor` and `health-events-analyzer` — are **derived from the
release namespace** for whichever of them are enabled.
They do not belong in this list, and installing into a namespace other than
`nvsentinel` needs no edit.

List only publishers this chart does not ship. Entries are matched **verbatim**
against the username TokenReview reports:

- form `system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<name>`
- namespace: DNS-1123 label, ≤63 characters
- name: DNS-1123 subdomain, ≤253 characters
- no leading, trailing or internal whitespace; no uppercase

Nothing is trimmed or normalised for you. An entry that does not match exactly
can never equal a real username, so the chart and the connector both reject it
rather than accepting a rule that silently matches nothing.

Omitting the key means "no additional callers". Writing `null` is refused,
because null and "none" are not the same statement.

### The per-caller rule

A caller presenting a token is asked two independent questions.

**1. Is the token being presented where it was issued?** If it carries a node
claim, that claim must name this connector's own node — for every caller,
allowlisted or not. Rejected as `node_claim_mismatch`.

**2. May this identity name other nodes?** Only if it is on the allowlist.
Otherwise it is pinned to the connector's node, and an event naming another node
is rejected as `node_mismatch`.

An allowlisted caller must also present a token bound to a **running pod on a
scheduled node**. `kubectl create token <sa> --audience=…` without
`--bound-object-ref` produces a token with neither claim; it is refused for
own-node events too, not merely downgraded.

Callers presenting **no** token are accepted and pinned to the connector's node.
Reaching the socket already granted that much.

### Where to run cross-node monitors

Their pods hold a credential platform-connector accepts for any node name. Run
them on a system or control-plane node pool rather than GPU nodes serving
tenants, using whichever of `nodeSelector`, `affinity` or tolerations your
cluster already uses.

### Metrics

| Metric | Labels | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `platform_connector_auth_decisions_total` | `decision` = `node_local` \| `cross_node` | Scope granted to a batch. |
| `platform_connector_auth_violations_total` | `reason` (below) | Batches that violated the node-binding rule. Under `mode: enforce` these are rejected; under `mode: audit` they are recorded but let through. |
| `platform_connector_auth_node_claim_total` | `result` = `verified` \| `absent` | Whether the token carried a node claim. |

`reason` values:

| Reason | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `node_mismatch` | A node-local caller named a different node. |
| `node_claim_mismatch` | The token was issued on another node. |
| `unbound_cross_node_token` | An allowlisted caller presented a token bound to no pod. |
| `cross_node_claim_absent` | Pod-bound, but the pod was never scheduled. |
| `token_missing` | Deployment platform connector only: the caller presented no token. There is no local node to pin a tokenless caller to. |
| `unbound_token` | Deployment platform connector only: the token is bound to no pod. |
| `node_claim_absent` | Deployment platform connector only: the token is bound to a pod that never scheduled, so there is no node to pin its events to. |
| `identity_not_allowed` | Deployment platform connector only: the identity is not in `ALLOWED_PUBLISHERS`. |
| `missing_node_name` | An event carried no node name and none could be stamped. |
| `token_invalid` | TokenReview rejected the token. |
| `malformed_credentials` | The authorization header was duplicated, or did not use the Bearer scheme. A *completely absent* header is not a violation — that caller is accepted and pinned to the connector's node. |
| `validator_unavailable` / `validator_timeout` / `validator_error` | The API server could not be reached, or returned no identity. With `failOpenOnUnavailable: true`, `validator_unavailable` and `validator_timeout` still increment this counter but fall back to a degraded node-local scope instead of rejecting the request — see [`failOpenOnUnavailable`](#failopenonunavailable) for how that scope treats a blank vs. a differently-named node. |

A healthy cluster reports zero violations. A sustained non-zero
`validator_unavailable` is an API-server problem, not a caller problem.

## Migration

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `crossNodeServiceAccounts` listing the bundled monitors | Remove them; they are derived from the release namespace. |

Upgrade the chart and the images together. New images against an old chart do
not start: the connector requires `enableNodeBindingAuth` to be present, and an
old chart does not write it.
